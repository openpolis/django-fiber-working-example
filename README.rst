This is a working example of a 
`django-fibe<https://github.com/ridethepony/django-fiber>`_-enabled site.

django-fiber is installed on a regular (although empty) django app.

The installation procedure
==========================

Create your django project.
I usually create a virtual environment with virtualenvwrapper's mkvirtualenv, to isolate versions.
Then I install django::

    pip install django
